Wiitop
======

## Preface

Wiitop was a tournament script created around 2005 I think. It used to be translated in 7 different languages and was used by something like 7000 different organizations on irc and irl.

But anyway, I remade the project to learn CodeIgniter and Sass and Zurb Foundation and... I made a mess. And I stopped being interested in the project and I moved on. And now wiitop.net is down and people are asking me for the script so this is a start... I pushed the entire source code.

The code is old, maybe unsecure, and also I can't find the .sass files that were a huge simplification of the trees...

## How to use it?

Copy the content in the src folder
create the database from wiitop.sql
configure application/config/database.php with your database password

## Can I use that?

I have no idea. If I had time I would ditch Foundation and use Bootstrap. I would update CodeIgniter or even try to use Laravel. I would redo the sass. I would fix things around. I would remove most js garbage and would update to a newer version of jQuery, or just move to Angular... There is a lot to do :/
